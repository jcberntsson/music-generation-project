# Generating music using CNN and GAN
A music generation project for Chalmers course SSY340. Made by Joakim Berntsson \& Adam Tonderski. Details of this project can be found in the [paper](asd.se).

## Dependencies
* Python 3.7
* Jupyter Notebook 4.4.0
* Keras 2.2.2
* Pretty Midi 0.2.8
* Matplotlib 2.2.2

## Data
The network support any kind of midi data, but is specifically tested with piano tracks, these are then extracted and combined before training on a predetermined sample size of Lx128, where L is the length.

## Training
To replicate the training, prepare midi files in the root directory, input the directory name in the process data step, go through the steps and train.

## Generating
Generating samples can be done with the DCGAN method `generate`. Pretrained weights can be found in the `weights/` folder and loaded with DCGAN method `load_weights`.

## Generated samples
Under `generated_samples/` you can find a few midi files generated by this network.
